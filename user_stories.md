<h3>User Story 9</h3>
As someone who engages in many communities online, I want to know the opinions of others in my circle on the strengths of other characters, so that I can explore and discuss other views on my favorite characters and media.

<h3>User Story 10</h3>
As someone who knows a lot of characters in many different games / shows / books / etc., I want to be able to sort their power based on one another, so that I can have a sense of scale of how powerful a character is based on the others I know.

<h3>User Story 11</h3>
As someone who makes my own characters with powers, I want to be able to see where the majority of character strengths and weaknesses lie, so that I can create a character that is not too over or underpowered.

<h3>User Story 12</h3>
As someone who likes action in media, I want to simulate fights between characters I know based on their strengths, so that I can visualize their fight and explore how they would interact with their skills.

<h3>Exception 9</h3>
If there is a disagreement of existing character strengths, the ratings will be slightly tweaked over time based on repeated polls and averaged out between each other.

<h3>Exception 10</h3>
If there are overpowered custom characters appearing in polls, the system will auto balance and match them up with other overpowered characters.

<h3>Exception 11</h3>
If there is an attempted sabotaging of simulated fights, the system will detect when many accounts in the same area vote on the same poll and put a temporary hold on that IP.

<h3>Exception 12</h3>
If character spam is detected, the system will put a 24 hour cooldown on the profile to give them time to focus on making their existing characters more fleshed out.
